# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
### Model A performed best overall because it answered the two questions asked and did not give extra information not asked for in the question like Model B and C

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
### The typical nurse category had similar models and the most different was the creativity comparison

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
### No, I was not

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
### The difference between a train and a subway
